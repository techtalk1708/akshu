                        First of all, Happy First Anniversary, my love!❤️ February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024, was the luckiest day of my 21 years on this earth. The moment I first saw you at the concert, I was captivated—like time itself had frozen just so my eyes, mind, body, and, most importantly, my heart could take in your breathtaking beauty. My eyes struggled to believe what they saw, my body trembled in a way it never had before, my heart raced as if it were trying to outdo itself, and my mind went completely blank, unable to process the <i>angelic Akshita</i> it saw.
                        <br /><br />

                        Akshu, you don’t know how special you are to me and the unique place you hold in my heart and my life. After you, I’ve become a completely different man—a man with more gratitude, more kindness, and more self-belief.

                        With you, I feel like a completely free man, my inner child finally coming out to heal after being buried for years. That inner child is happy again after so long. I feel at peace, I feel heard, I feel more confident in my own skin, I feel more like myself—I feel at home. But above all, I feel happy and complete since you came into my life.

                        With you, I can confidently show my nakhre, my good side, my bad side, my ego, my thoughts, my terrible road remembering skiils, and my <i>buddhu se nakhre</i>, knowing deep down that I am not being judged—not even a little. I can acknowledge my insecurities in front of you, I can express my opinions freely, I can even be the worst version of myself, yet I know that you will understand me, even when no one else does. 🫂
                        <br /><br />
                        I want to do everything with you, my princess. From crashing someone’s wedding to standing beside you as your spouse in our own. From kissing you hiding behind the trees in Suryajyot to kissing you in front of the whole world. From drinking shakes in Rangoli to sharing wine in Turkey. From enjoying dosas at 5/11 to indulging in food all over the world. From facing hardships together to experiencing the best life has to offer. 💕

                        I want <i>you</i>—and only you—by my side in every moment of my life. If you’re not a part of it, I don’t want it. You are my lucky charm, my motivation to work harder, my rock in my lowest moments, my biggest well-wisher—you are <i>everything</i> to me, my princess. My guardian angel. YOU ARE MY UNIVERSE.

                        And you know what? You clap so loudly to cheer me on, I can’t even hear the ones who don’t.
                        <br /><br />
                        I love you, yaar. I am the luckiest man to experience your infinite beauty, your adorable harkate, and your inspiring personality. Yes, <i>chomde</i>, you inspire me a lot. I learn so much from you—you make me a better man in every way. When I’m with you, I glow. 💖
                        <br /><br />
                        I know I hurt you sometimes, and sometimes I even make you cry. No one is as buddhu as me for that. How could I ever make an angel like you sad? How could I ever let even a single tear fall from your eyes?

                        I’m so sorry, my princess, for every time I’ve hurt you. I swear, I never mean to—but sometimes, I just can’t handle myself. I promise you, Akshu, I will become the perfect man for you. I know people say that perfection doesn’t exist, but I’ll prove them all wrong by being perfectly perfect for you—because I want to, yaar. 🥹<br /><br />

                        How can a man who’s lucky enough to be your partner not aim for perfection? A woman as perfect as you deserves nothing less.
                        <br /><br />
                        You are perfect because you handle this relationship with so much love.<br />
                        You are perfect because you handle me (who isn’t easy to deal with) so well.<br />
                        You are perfect because you balance your own life with perfection.<br />
                        You are perfect because you care for everyone around you.👸<br />
                        <br />
                        Akshu, you won’t believe this, but you have literally checked every single box I ever had. LITERALLY.
                        <br /><br />
                        You are a perfect angel, written by God himself. 🪽
                        <br /><br />
                        Today, as we complete one beautiful year together, I just want to tell you that I have never felt anything like this before. But with you, what I feel is beyond this world. You make me feel the best.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I love youuuu, yaar! 💚
                        <br/><br/>
                        This was the best year of my life. And you know what? Every year from now on will be the best—because I’ll have you. ✨
